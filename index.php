                        <dt>Eat a healthy diet</dt>
                        <dd>Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole
                            grains. Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day. You
                            can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal;
                            eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and
                            eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and
                            noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</dd>
                        <dt> Consume less salt and sugar</dt>
                        <dd>On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth decay
                            and unhealthy weight gain. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be
                            reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to 50g or about 12
                            teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less than 5% of total energy intake for
                            additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake by limiting the consumption of
                            sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages.</dd>
                        <dt>Be active</dt>
                        <dd>Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that
                            requires energy expenditure. This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working,
                            playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits.
                            The amount of physical activity you need depends on your age group but adults aged 18-64
                            years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the
                            week. Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for additional
                            health benefits.</dd>
                        <dt>Don’t smoke</dt>
                        <dd>Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills
                            not only the direct smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently,
                            there are around 15.9 million Filipino adults who smoke tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are
                            interested or plan to quit.
                            If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience
                            immediate and long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start
                            smoking and fight for your right to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.</dd>
                        <dt>Drink only safe water</dt>
                        <dd>Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis
                            A, typhoid and polio. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source
                            contaminated with faeces. Check with your water concessionaire and water refilling station
                            to ensure that the water you’re drinking is safe. In a setting where you are unsure of your
                            water source, boil your water for at least one minute. This will destroy harmful organisms
                            in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking.</dd>
                        <dt>Clean your hands properly</dt>
                        <dd>Hand hygiene is critical not only for health workers but for everyone. Clean hands can
                            prevent the spread of infectious illnesses. You should handwash using soap and water when
                            your hands are visibly soiled or handrub using an alcohol-based product.</dd>
                        <dt>Have regular check-ups</dt>
                        <dd>Regular check-ups can help find health problems before they start. Health professionals can
                            help find and diagnose health issues early, when your chances for treatment and cure are
                            better. Go to your nearest health facility to check out the the health services, screenings
                            and treatment that are accessible to you.</dd>
